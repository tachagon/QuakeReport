Quake Report App
===================================

This app displays a list of recent earthquakes in the world from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization.
I learned to build this app in a Udacity course ([Android Basics: Networking](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-networking--ud843)).
